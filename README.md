This repository contains the code and datasets required to reproduce the maps and visualisations in the forthcoming manuscript *Financialisation and Local Statecraft in England: Councillors at the Casino?* authored by Andy Pike (Newcastle University).

Graphs and charts are organised by theme, dealing with: the Local Autonomy Index ([LAI](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/tree/main/lai)); mapped boundaries of local government ([boundaries](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/tree/main/boundaries)); change in spending power over time ([spending power](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/tree/main/spendingpower)); changing in commercial activities ([trading accounts](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/tree/main/tradingaccounts)); and auditing of local government ([audits](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/tree/main/tradingaccounts)).
