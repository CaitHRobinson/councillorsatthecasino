# Investments by Local Authority type

Replicate the swarm charts of investments using [code](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/blob/main/investment/investment.R) and relevant [data](https://github.com/CaitHRobinson/councillorsatthecasino/blob/main/investment/Investments_LA_bytype.csv).

Local government investments per capita by local government type for the year 2019 in: (i) bank deposits; (ii) money market funds; (iii) other investments. ‘Other investments’ include items local governments report as rest of world banks, other securities, and other investments. All figures are as reported by local authorities so may differ from levels published by other sources. Population is based on 2018 data, therefore only 325 comparable areas from across England are included for which we have population data.
